1. **Network Policies**  
   - Many candidates struggle with configuring and troubleshooting Network Policies because they require a good understanding of Kubernetes networking.  
   - Example Task: Restrict ingress and egress traffic to pods based on labels.

2. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**  
   - Diagnosing issues with failed Pods, CrashLoopBackOffs, or misconfigured workloads is challenging.  
   - Example Task: Identify and fix a failing Deployment.

3. **Stateful Workloads (Persistent Volumes)**  
   - Persistent Volumes and StatefulSets can be tricky due to their complex configurations.  
   - Example Task: Configure a StatefulSet with proper PVCs and test data persistence.

4. **Multi-Container Pods (Sidecar Patterns)**  
   - Understanding how to configure multi-container Pods for logging, monitoring, or data sharing can be challenging.  
   - Example Task: Implement a sidecar container to share logs with the main application.

5. **Application Resiliency and Scaling**  
   - Configuring liveness/readiness probes or horizontal scaling under specific conditions is often tested.  
   - Example Task: Add probes to a Pod and set up auto-scaling based on CPU usage.
