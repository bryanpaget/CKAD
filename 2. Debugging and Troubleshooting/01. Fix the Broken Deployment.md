#### Task: Fix the Broken Deployment

A Deployment named `broken-app` is already running in the cluster, but its pods are stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state.

1. Identify and fix the issue causing the pods to crash.
2. The Deployment should:
   - Use the image `nginx:1.21`.
   - Serve traffic on port `80`.

To check the state of the pods, run:  
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

To view the pod logs, run:  
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
